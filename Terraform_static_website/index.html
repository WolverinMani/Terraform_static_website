    <h1>Singh Avishas - New to Terraform</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Singh Avishas's page! He is new to Terraform, a powerful tool
      for managing infrastructure as code. Terraform allows him to define,
      provision, and manage infrastructure resources in a cloud-agnostic way.
      It's a great choice for automating the deployment of cloud services,
      virtual machines, and other resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Singh Avishas is excited to embark on his journey to learn Terraform and
      leverage its capabilities to improve infrastructure management and
      deployment processes. He looks forward to exploring its features and
      applying them to real-world projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stay tuned as Singh Avishas learns the ins and outs of Terraform and
      shares his experiences and projects on this page!
